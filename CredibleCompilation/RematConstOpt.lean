# Rematerialize-Constant Optimizer (documented stub, not wired into pipeline)

## Status

Implemented as a conservative `.const`-instruction-sinking pass. All 24
canonical Livermore kernels pass cert validation when this pass is wired
into the pipeline, **but measured runtime is unchanged within noise**
(<0.5% on heavy kernels). The conservative form simply moves `.const v c`
past adjacent instructions that don't reference v, shortening v's live
range by 1 PC at a time; in practice this either doesn't fire often or
doesn't shorten the range enough to free a register that wasn't already
free.

The pass is NOT wired into the standard pipeline. The file remains as a
marker that this conservative approach was tried and didn't help — and
as a starting point for the impactful variant described below.

## What this conservative pass does

  pc:    .const t v                    pc:    <swap candidate at pc+1>
  pc+1:  <unrelated instr that         pc+1:  .const t v
          doesn't use t>          →

If pc+1 is non-branching, doesn't define or use t, the swap is
semantics-preserving and shortens t's live range by 1 PC. Iterated up to
N times to sink past multiple instructions.

Cert: 1:1 transformation, fits the existing certificate framework directly.

## What would actually help (NOT implemented here)

The impactful form of rematerialization is **per-use-site splitting**:
for each `.const v c` with multiple uses, insert a fresh `.const v_use_i c`
right before each use, rename the use's reference, drop the original.

That converts ONE long-lived variable into MANY short-lived ones, each of
which RegAlloc trivially fits in a register. Estimated speedup based on
the asm analysis: 5–15% on constant-heavy kernels (k09, k15, k01, k04, k07).

Why it's not done here: the per-use split adds instructions to the program,
breaking the existing 1:1 cert framework. It needs FMAFusionOpt-style
non-1:1 plumbing with origMap / skipArr / revMap and corresponding cert
generation. ~1–2 days of cert engineering plus the pass itself.
