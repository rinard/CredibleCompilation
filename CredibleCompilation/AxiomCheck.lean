# `AxiomCheck` — a build-failing axiom-cleanliness gate

`#assert_clean_axioms foo` fails elaboration (hence `lake build`) unless `foo` depends **only** on the
permitted axioms `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` — in particular it rejects any `sorryAx`.

Unlike `#print axioms` (which only *prints* the axiom set, so a regression that dirties a proof slips
through silently), this is a real gate: assert it on a theorem and the axiom-cleanliness claim is
mechanically enforced at build time, not eyeballed. Subsets of the permitted set pass (a cleaner
theorem is still clean); only a *disallowed* axiom fails.

Ported from the Nexis backend (`BaseLanguage/Meta/AxiomCheck.lean`) to gate the verified assembly
encoder (`CredibleCompilation/AsmEnc.lean`). Note: the whole-pipeline capstone
(`compileProgramAst_correctness`) is *not* clean under this gate — it legitimately depends on the two
floating-point trust axioms (`FloatBinOp.fadd_comm`, `Flags.condHolds_float_correct`) and
`native_decide`'s `Lean.ofReduceBool`/`Lean.trustCompiler`; the gate is applied to the new
encoder theorems, which are axiom-clean.
