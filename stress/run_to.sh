# Portable per-command timeout. macOS ships no `timeout`/`gtimeout`/`setsid`, so this uses a
# background job + a sleep-watchdog that kills it (the same trick certfuzz.sh uses inline).
#
# Usage:  run_to.sh SECONDS cmd [args...]
# Exit:   the command's exit code, or 124 if it was killed for running past SECONDS.
#
# Use it to guard anything that can loop or be pathologically slow on adversarial input — the
# optimizer passes and the certificate checker (via compiler / certaudit / certmutate), and any
# compiled program you run. A timeout is a candidate non-termination / pathological-slowness
# finding, not a failure to retry.
